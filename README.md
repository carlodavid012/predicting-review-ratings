# Predicting Amazon Review Ratings

In the online world, reviews are becoming more important every day. We decide our purchases, make our travel plans, outings, which shows to watch all based on reviews. As such, for businesses and platforms it is important to understand what drives the reviews, whether they are endorsing or complaining, and how credible they are.

In this project we are going to make use of Amazon's public dataset of reviews about its products. This dataset contains 792, 113 reviews.
